# Colossal Cave Adventure

Original source code, written in Fortran, from the very first text adventure game in the history (1976).

I collected some other goodies from around the internet (maps, walkthroughs...). Even executables for Windows & Mac OS !

I heard about the game in the Halt & Catch Fire TV series. Googled it a bit and found the original `src`. This repository is for educational purposes only.
