You are on the edge of a breath-taking view. Far below you is an
active volcano, from which great gouts of molten lava come surging
out, cascading back down into the depths.  The glowing rock fills the
farthest reaches of the cavern with a blood-red glare, giving every-
thing an eerie, macabre appearance.  The air is filled with flickering
sparks of ash and a heavy smell of brimstone.  The walls are hot to
the touch, and the thundering of the volcano drowns out all other
sounds.  Embedded in the jagged roof far overhead are myriad twisted
formations composed of pure white alabaster, which scatter the murky
light into sinister apparitions upon the walls.  To one side is a deep
gorge, filled with a bizarre chaos of tortured rock which seems to
have been crafted by the devil himself.  An immense river of fire
crashes out from the depths of the volcano, burns its way through the
gorge, and plummets into a bottomless pit far off to your left.
Across the gorge, the entrance to a valley is dimly visible.  To
the right, an immense geyser of blistering steam erupts continuously
from a barren island in the center of a sulfurous lake, which bubbles
ominously.  The far right wall is aflame with an incandescence of its
own, which lends an additional infernal splendor to the already
hellish scene.  A dark, foreboding passage exits to the south.

The earth begins to shudder violently, and smoke flows up from the
gorge beneath your feet.  With a violent >glop<, the volcano

of wheat-colored stone that bridges the gorge.

As you approach the center of the archway, hot vapors saturated with
brimstone drift up from the lava in the gorge beneath your feet.  The
mithril ring in your hand quivers and glows, and the fumes eddy away

You are standing at the southern end of a long valley illuminated by
flickering red light from the volcanic gorge behind you.  Carved

Some of them look down into the valley with expressions of
benevolence that would credit a saint;  others glare with a malice
that makes the heart grow faint.  All of them are imbued with a
fantastic seeming of life by the shifting and flickering light of
the volcano.  The entire far end of the valley is taken up by an
immense carving of a seated figure;  its exact form cannot be seen
from here due to the uncertainty of the light.

You're in a small, nondescript chamber.  A dark passage leads up

covered with rubies, and has the words "Omar Khayyam" engraved
on the side!!

The wax seal breaks away easily.  A cloud of dark smoke pours up from
the mouth of the flask and condenses into the form of a twelve-foot
Djinn standing in the pentagram.  He pushes experimentally at the
magical wall of the pentagram (which holds), and nods politely to
you.  "MY THANKS, OH MORTAL," he says in an incredibly deep bass
voice.  "IT HAS BEEN THREE THOUSAND YEARS SINCE SOLOMON SEALED ME
INTO THAT BOTTLE, AND I AM GRATEFUL THAT YOU HAVE RELEASED ME.  IF
YOU WILL OPEN THIS PENTAGRAM AND LET ME GO FREE, I WILL GIVE YOU SOME
ADVICE THAT YOU MAY ONE DAY WISH TO POSSESS."
>
open pentagram
The pentagram's magical barrier sparks fitfully and goes down.  The
Djinn stretches gratefully and smiles at you.  "AGAIN, MY THANKS," he
says.  "MY ADVICE TO YOU WILL TAKE THE FORM OF A HISTORY LESSON.
WHEN RALPH WITT, THE ARCHITECT AND CONSTRUCTOR OF THIS CAVE, WAS VERY
YOUNG, HE BECAME VERY INCENSED THAT HIS NAME WAS AT THE END OF THE
ALPHABET.  HE FELT (FOR SOME REASON) THAT THE LETTER W BELONGED NEAR
THE BEGINNING OF THE ALPHABET, AND THAT ALL OF THOSE "UPSTART LETTERS
WHICH UNFAIRLY USURPED THE BEST PLACES" SHOULD BE FORCED INTO EXILE
AT THE END OF THE ALPHABET.  HIS INSTINCT FOR MATTERS MAGICAL AND
MYSTICAL LED HIM TO APPLY THIS STRANGE BELIEF INTO THE CAVE'S
STRUCTURE WHEN HE EXCAVATED IT.  YOU HAVEN'T YET BEEN AFFECTED BY HIS
STRANGE HABITS, BUT YOU SHOULD REMEMBER THIS.  FAREWELL, AND GOOD
LUCK."  With that, the Djinn evaporates into a cloud of smoke and
drifts rapidly away.
>
look
You're in a small room with a very smooth rock floor, onto which
has been marked a pentagram.  A low crawl leads out to the west, and
a crack in the rock leads north.

There is a small, empty earthenware flask here.

The crack in the rock ends here, but a narrow chimney leads up.  You
should be able to climb it.

You're at the top of a narrow chimney in the rock.  A cylindrical
tube composed of hardened lava leads south.
>
s
The lava tube continues down and to the south, but it becomes very
steep here - if you go down it you probably won't be able to get
back up.

A large phosphorescent cloud of smoke drifts into view, and a large
mouth and two dark eyes take shape on the side.  One of the eyes winks
at you, and the djinn's deep voice says "GREETINGS AGAIN, MORTAL.  I
HAVE REMEMBERED A PIECE OF ANCIENT LORE THAT I LEARNED FROM MY AUNT,
AN AFREET OF GREAT KNOWLEDGE.  THERE IS ANOTHER MAGIC WORD THAT YOU
MIGHT FIND OF USE IF YOU SHOULD EVER FIND YOURSELF BEING ATTACKED BY
THOSE PESTIFEROUS DWARVES.  YOU SHOULD USE IT ONLY AS A LAST RESORT,
THOUGH, SINCE IT IS A MOST POTENT WORD AND IS PRONE TO BACKFIRE FOR
NO OBVIOUS REASON;  ALSO, IT SHOULD NEVER BE USED NEAR WATER OR NEAR
ANY SHARP WEAPON OR THE RESULTS MAY BE MOST UNFORTUNATE.  THE WORD
IS 'phuggg'", whispers the djinn, "AND IT MUST BE PRONOUNCED CAREFULLY
IF IT IS TO HAVE THE PROPER EFFECT.  FAREWELL AGAIN, AND GOOD LUCK!"
With that, the djinn-cloud drifts away out of sight.

You are at the eastern end of the Audience Hall.  There is a large
dais rising out of the floor here;  resting upon the dais is a strange-
looking throne made out of interlocking bars and rods of metal.

Resting on the throne ("sitting" isn't really the right word) is an
incredible skeleton.  It is fairly humanoid from the waist up (except
for its incredible size and four extra arms);  below that, it resembles
the body of a giant python, and is wrapped in and around the bars and
rods of the throne.  Clutched in one bony hand is a long sceptre,
ornately encrusted with sapphires!!

You pluck the sceptre from the skeleton's bony hand.  As you do, the

forboding tone; it then sags to the ground and crumbles into dust which
drifts away into the still air of the cave.

You are standing at the southern end of a long valley illuminated by
flickering red light from the volcanic gorge behind you.  Carved
into the walls of the valley is an incredible series of stone faces.
Some of them look down into the valley with expressions of
benevolence that would credit a saint;  others glare with a malice
that makes the heart grow faint.  All of them are imbued with a
fantastic seeming of life by the shifting and flickering light of
the volcano.  The entire far end of the valley is taken up by an
immense carving of a seated figure;  its exact form cannot be seen
from here due to the uncertainty of the light.

There is a wheat-colored stone bridge arching over the gorge.
>
s
You are on the edge of a breath-taking view. Far below you is an
active volcano, from which great gouts of molten lava come surging
out, cascading back down into the depths.  The glowing rock fills the
farthest reaches of the cavern with a blood-red glare, giving every-
thing an eerie, macabre appearance.  The air is filled with flickering
sparks of ash and a heavy smell of brimstone.  The walls are hot to
the touch, and the thundering of the volcano drowns out all other
sounds.  Embedded in the jagged roof far overhead are myriad twisted
formations composed of pure white alabaster, which scatter the murky
light into sinister apparitions upon the walls.  To one side is a deep
gorge, filled with a bizarre chaos of tortured rock which seems to
have been crafted by the devil himself.  An immense river of fire
crashes out from the depths of the volcano, burns its way through the
gorge, and plummets into a bottomless pit far off to your left.
Across the gorge, the entrance to a valley is dimly visible.  To
the right, an immense geyser of blistering steam erupts continuously
from a barren island in the center of a sulfurous lake, which bubbles
ominously.  The far right wall is aflame with an incandescence of its
own, which lends an additional infernal splendor to the already
hellish scene.  A dark, foreboding passage exits to the south.

a lava beach.  The shelf is an extension of an incredible cliff

a twisting coral passage exits to the west.

You are standing on a short, barren beach composed of hardened lava.
Rugged and unclimbable volcanic hills block all view to the north
and south, and a seemingly infinite cliff fills the entire western
hemisphere.  To the east, a narrow inlet of ocean water laps gently
upon the beach.  The scene is illuminated by the light of three small
moons shining through the shimmering glow of an aurora that fills
the entire sky with golden splendor.  Steps lead up the cliff to a
shelf of rock.

Lying upon the beach are the shattered remains of what must once have
been a dinghy.  The remains consist of little more than a few broken
boards, upon one of which may be seen a crude sketch of a skull and two
crossed thighbones (perhaps this dinghy was once owned by a cook?)

You are in a north/south canyon about 25 feet across. The floor is
covered by white mist seeping in from the north.  The walls extend
upward for well over 100 feet.  Suspended from some unseen point far
above you, an enormous two-sided mirror is hanging parallel to and
midway between the canyon walls.  (The mirror is obviously provided
for the use of the dwarves, who as you know, are extremely vain.)  A
small window can be seen in either wall, some fifty feet up.
