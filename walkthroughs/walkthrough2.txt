           WALKTHROUGH FOR COLOSSAL CAVES ADVENTURE

                      by Sean L. Palmer
                released to the public domain

This is a walkthrough for the 350-point version of the Colossal Caves
Adventure by Crowther and Woods.  It starts from the start of the game
outside the building, and is (more or less) the exact commands needed
to win the game with the maximum number of points.  DO NOT use this
walkthrough unless you have already solved the game or are just really
stuck and have exhausted all other methods of getting hints (like
typing "HELP" in the game itself).  This walkthrough WILL RUIN THE
GAME for you if you haven't already solved it, and you'll hate yourself
forever for not sticking it out on your own.  Besides, winning isn't
everything, and some of my favorite memories from the game are some
of the clever responses it gives for trying some of the wrong ways to
solve a puzzle (like try typing "kill troll" or "throw axe" at the
troll sometime.)  This walkthrough will NOT solve any of the versions
which have more total points.  It is not a 100% optimal walkthrough,
and I'm sure a few improvements can be made, though it is considerably
better than at least one other walkthrough I've seen (less total moves).
It is also not documented very well, so you are expected to halfway
know your way around, though I've put some locations down for
synchronization purposes.  It also assumes that you don't find the
first dwarf (the one who throws the axe) before completing the first
trip into the cave (else you'll have too many items to carry). It also
(whew!) assumes that you will pick up the axe as soon as you see it,
and kill the other dwarves you see as you see them, and retrieve the
axe afterwards. It also assumes that the pirate doesn't steal any
treasure until you actually get into the maze of twisty little passages,
all alike, or else you'll have to modify the chest-retrieval bit to
account for it. Due to these random events, and certain other ones like
passages occasionally dumping you into the same room you left from,
this is not an exact walkthrough, and feeding the inputs shown into
the game via input redirection will NOT work (unfortunately). You have
to deal with the extra events as they happen, and maybe try several
times before circumstances work out and you win the game.
Notice: some versions of the game do not treat 'get' the same as 'take',
and will complain at you if you type 'get x', but will accept 'take x'.
In this case, replace all occurrences of 'get' in the walkthrough with
'take' and all will be well.

Now, without further ado, 'You are at the end of a road, outside a
small building...'

///////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////

The other walkthrough finishes the game in about 243 moves, not counting
the dwarves and waiting for the pirate and getting out of Witt's End.
This finishes in around 215 moves with those same stipulations.
It could probably be improved by a few moves at least.

Note 1:
 If the pirate hasn't stolen something by now, you are basically screwed, but
 you can try the sequence se,n,w,w,w,e,e,w,s,n,s,s,s,n,e,n,e,nw over and over
 to try to find him before your lamp runs out.

Note 2:
 Don't go west here. Keep trying N and you'll eventually get out.
 After moving the magazines, I recommend going somewhere with light (either
 by the grate or in the plover room) and waste some time until the Cave closes.
